# OPIOID

'Opioid_Segments.nii' is a NIfTI file of brain opioid segments in the MNI space derived based on the distribution of opioid and dopamine receptors in the MNI space. See Shokri-Kojori et al. (2022) for more details. Brain regions are labeled as follows:

- Areas with a value of 1: primary opioid segment
- Areas with a value of 2: secondary opioid segment
- Areas with a value of 3: striatum
- Areas with a value of 4: white matter and CSF

'DOR.nii' is a NIfTI file of average delta opioid receptor availability in the MNI space (n = 10, 9 males). For normalization and template generation please cite: Shokri-Kojori, E. et al. (2022). Original PET data were reported in Weerts et al. (2011). 

'KOR.nii' is a NIfTI file of average kappa opioid receptor availability in the MNI space (n = 10, 10 males). For kinetic modelling, normalization, and template generation please cite: Shokri-Kojori, E. et al. (2022). Original PET data were reported in Naganawa et al. (2014).

'MOR.nii' is a NIfTI file of average mu opioid receptor availability in the MNI space (n = 10, 6 males). For normalization and template generation please cite: Shokri-Kojori, E. et al. (2022). Original PET data were reported in Kuwabara et al. (2014).
